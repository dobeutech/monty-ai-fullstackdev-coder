# Claude Agent Initialization Workflow

When the user asks to "initialize claude agent" or "initialize the claude agent":

1. **Copy this entire directory** (`E:\cursor\cursor-projects\my-agent`) to the target folder/directory where the user wants to initialize the agent
2. **Navigate to the copied directory** in the terminal
3. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the copied directory
4. **Run the agent**: Execute `npm start` or `npm run agent:init` to start the initialization process
5. **Follow the prompts**: The agent will ask for a project specification and set up the feature list

## Quick Reference

- Source directory: `E:\cursor\cursor-projects\my-agent`
- Installation: `npm install`
- Initialization: `npm start` (auto-detects) or `npm run agent:init` (force init mode)
- Coding sessions: `npm run agent:code` (for subsequent development sessions)

## Project Structure

This is a Claude Agent SDK framework for long-running agents with:
- Two-agent architecture (Initializer + Coding Agent)
- JSON-based feature tracking
- Browser automation testing
- Progress persistence across sessions
- Git integration

See `README.md` for full documentation.
