================================================================================
NOTES FOR FUTURE CODING AGENTS
================================================================================

1. ALWAYS check feature_list.json before starting work to avoid duplicate efforts

2. Mark features as passing ONLY after verification via browser automation tests

3. Update this progress file at the END of each session with:
   - Features completed
   - Current blockers
   - Next recommended steps

4. Follow existing code patterns:
   - Use TypeScript strict mode
   - Follow React 19 best practices (no deprecated patterns)
   - Use Tailwind utility classes, avoid custom CSS
   - Leverage shadcn/ui components for consistency

5. Testing workflow:
   - Write Playwright tests as features are implemented
   - Run tests locally before marking features as complete
   - Ensure tests pass in CI/CD pipeline

6. Accessibility is NON-NEGOTIABLE:
   - Every interactive element must be keyboard accessible
   - All images must have alt text
   - Forms must have proper labels and error announcements

7. Multi-language support:
   - Add translations to i18n files for ALL user-facing text
   - Test language switching functionality
   - Ensure RTL support if adding Arabic/Hebrew in future

8. Performance monitoring:
   - Run Lighthouse audits regularly
   - Check bundle sizes after adding dependencies
   - Optimize images before committing

9. Security first:
   - Never commit API keys or secrets
   - Always validate user input
   - Use Supabase RLS policies for data access control

10. Git commit conventions:
    - Use conventional commits format
    - Include [agent] prefix for agent-generated commits
    - Reference feature IDs in commit messages

================================================================================
SESSION: 2026-01-14 - 01:40 AM (First Development Session)
Agent: Claude Sonnet 4.5
Focus: Initial setup, backend verification, and priority feature testing
================================================================================

ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Verified development environment setup
   - Confirmed project location: E:\cursor\cursor-projects\uniquestaffingprofessionals\unique-staffing-prof
   - Verified package.json and dependencies installed
   - Checked Supabase configuration (.env file present with valid credentials)
   - Confirmed Supabase URL: https://ynedsbgiveycubmusjzf.supabase.co
   
2. Started development server
   - Successfully launched Vite dev server on http://localhost:5000
   - Server running in background for testing
   
3. Verified basic application functionality
   - Ran existing verification scripts (verify-app-full.mjs)
   - Results: 5/7 tests passed
   - Homepage loads correctly with application form
   - Form has all expected fields (40+ inputs including checkboxes)
   - Auth/demo login has known issues (401 Unauthorized - expected without proper setup)
   
4. Backend infrastructure check
   - Supabase credentials configured and valid
   - Migration files exist in supabase/migrations/ (15 migration files)
   - Database tables should be created (applicants, jobs, analytics, etc.)
   - Storage buckets configured for resume uploads
   - Note: Migrations may already be applied to remote database

5. Created browser automation tests for priority features
   - Developed test scripts using Puppeteer for E2E testing
   - Tests validate actual user interaction flows
   - Screenshots captured for verification

FEATURES COMPLETED:

✅ feat-001 (Priority 1): Public application form - Basic information fields
   - Status: PASSING
   - Last Tested: 2026-01-14T06:49:50.888Z
   - Details: All form fields (name, email, phone) present and functional

✅ feat-002 (Priority 1): Resume upload functionality  
   - Status: PASSING
   - Last Tested: 2026-01-14T06:50:41.683Z
   - Details: Resume upload field found, PDF upload successful
   - Test verified: File input present, PDF accepted, success indicator shown, filename displayed
   - Test file: test-feat-002.mjs

✅ feat-005 (Priority 1): Form validation - Email format validation
   - Status: PASSING
   - Last Tested: 2026-01-14T06:52:02.568Z
   - Details: Email validation working correctly
   - Test verified: Invalid formats rejected (missing @, no domain), valid emails accepted
   - Test file: test-feat-005-006.mjs

✅ feat-006 (Priority 1): Form validation - Phone number format validation
   - Status: PASSING
   - Last Tested: 2026-01-14T06:52:02.568Z
   - Details: Phone validation functional
   - Test verified: Short numbers trigger errors, various formats accepted
   - Formats tested: (301) 555-1234, 301-555-1234, 3015551234, +1 301 555 1234
   - Test file: test-feat-005-006.mjs

BLOCKERS/ISSUES:
1. Admin authentication requires valid Supabase auth setup
   - Demo login does not redirect to dashboard (returns 401)
   - This is expected without proper admin user configuration
   - Not blocking public application form features

2. Form field behavior
   - Inputs use `id` attributes instead of `name` attributes
   - Tests adjusted to use #id selectors instead of [name=""] selectors
   - Phone field accumulates text in test (minor test script issue, not app issue)

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Application uses React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- Form component: EnhancedApplyForm.tsx (926 lines)
- Form fields validated on blur/input change
- Real-time validation with error messages
- Supabase integration for data persistence

NEXT STEPS:
1. Continue testing priority 1 features:
   - feat-007: Required fields validation
   - feat-008: Form submission flow
   - feat-011/012: Email verification system

2. Test priority 2 features:
   - feat-003: File type validation (PDF, DOC, DOCX)
   - feat-004: File size validation (max 10MB)
   - feat-009/010: Database persistence and storage

3. Set up admin authentication for dashboard testing

4. Test multi-language support (English, Spanish, French)

5. Test accessibility features and dark mode

CURRENT PROGRESS:
- Total Features: 187
- Features Passing: 4 (2.1%)
- Features Tested This Session: 4
- Time Spent: ~1 hour
- Tests Created: 3 test scripts

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT SESSION:
1. Focus on completing all priority 1 features first (highest ROI)
2. Create test suite runner to execute all tests in sequence
3. Consider setting up proper admin authentication for dashboard testing
4. Test form submission end-to-end with database verification
5. Verify email verification flow (may require email service setup)
